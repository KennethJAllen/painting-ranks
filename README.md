Piet Mondrian, a Dutch painter, was a principal figure in the Neoplasticism art movement. His art is characterized by a reduction to the essentials of form and color, using a grid-based format, and primary colors along with black, white, and gray.

Mondrian's works are known for their geometric abstraction, with compositions of rectangles and straight lines. His style marked a significant departure from traditional art forms, focusing on simplicity and fundamental elements.
